Our logo celebrates the pride tradition of
our society in both contemporary and optimistic ways.
The reaching or leaping horse in a globe mark represents

the clarity and strength of our clear path forward, with
confidence and optimism, always looking to the future.</p>
<p className=" text-sm p-1 text-[#4F57A0] leading-relaxed m-2">
Our reaching and leaping horse in a globe is looking ahead,
leads forward and upward. It’s a sign of wisdom, progress,
devotion, power, victory, glory, freedom, nobleness, endurance,

trust, confidence, heroism, competition, courage, wealth, new
beginning and growth. The “8” stripes on the horse also represents
the Geda System which our core values are guided by.
